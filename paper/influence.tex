\begin{abstract}
Influence maximization is the problem of finding an optimal set of influencial nodes in a network to maximize the spread of information. Social networks have grown and evolved in recent years, and so have the methods of solving this problem. In this paper, we will discuss approaches from previous papers, while focusing on a promising data-based approach. We will compare the performance by applying it to multiple different networks and discuss the results of our experiments.

\section{Introduction}
Influence Maximization is a problem that has been studied thoroughly over the years and dates back further than our earliest online social networks. Ever since humans started connecting with each other through the Internet, there have been people who have been interested in the potential value of being able to reach and influence as many users in a network as possible with the least amount of effort, resources and complexity. During the early days of influence spread research, spread maximization was achieved by analyzing centrality measures in relatively small social graphs. Later, during the widespread adoption of online social networks the motivation for this started revolving around viral marketing, wanting to initiate and maximize the reach of word-of-mouth advertising campaigns. Since then, social networks have changed and grown tremendously as more and more people adopt these novel efficient means of communication. Recently it has become more apparent that entities might be using this type of knowledge to influence communities for other purposes than viral advertising. Foreign powers might want to affect outcomes of elections in other countries for economic or political gain by targeting users with tailored news articles in order to influence to tone of widespread debate and discussion. \textit{(There is evidence to suggest that this might have happened during the last presidential elections in the United States)}. Increasingly, the companies behind the social networks we use, are collecting an ever larger amount of behavioral information. This information can be used to predict the behaviour of nodes and target potential influential users with tailored content.

\subsection{The varying nature of social graphs}

Social networks vary in structure and have diffrent characteristics because they serve different purposes. The behaviour of users will vary accross networks. Many of us are regular users of multiple social networks. On Facebook, we might be discussing and chatting with a narrow group of reasonably close friends while we might choose to follow complete strangers and celebrities on Twitter based on their interests and opinions. The way we interact with people will vary in different contexts. The way this information is presented also affects our behavior. The algorithms that curate the news feeds of these various networks all have their own sets of specific characteristics. This affects what we can see, along with our options for reacting to the data we are presented with. We assume that these differences may affect the way information can spread. In this paper, we will describe and compare the spread of influence through different networks in order to find the most suitable structures for influence maximization.

\subsection{Using available data to predict\\ influenceability}
Social graphs are growing at such a rate, that the early methods of finding seed nodes are becoming increasingly unrealistic. They relied on computationally expensive probabilistic simulations to estimate the influence-ability of nodes in order to build sets of seed nodes. They ignore potential beneficial factors that could be considered when selecting nodes. Later studies introduced methods to exploit previous propagation traces to evaluate the influenceability of nodes, avoiding the need for guesswork and costly simulations.\cite{goyal:datainfluence} They distribute credit to potential influencers of nodes and give them a score, their probability of influence. These methods proved to be vastly superior, more efficient and scalable than previous techniques according to their experiments. Some of the most recent work, such as [Robust influence maximization, Xinran He, David Kempe 2016], suggested that we should consider even more diverse behavioural and environmental data to predict influence. We could find nodes to spread certain topics based on their interests, political leanings and opinions. In their paper they experimented with various data sets to try to identify a set of k nodes who are simultaneously influential for multiple functions or models.


\section{Related and previous work}

In all of the research we have studied, the optimization problems have been focused on finding an initial set of “seed” nodes which would maximize the influenceability through a network.

In 2003, a time before Facebook and Twitter, Kempe et al. \cite{kempe:maxspread}, suggested probabilistic simulation oriented approaches to select an initial set of seed nodes to maximize spread and cause a cascade effect through a network. They compared their novel techniques with older models and proved with various experiments that their methods outperform those which were based on classic graph measures such as degree centrality and distance centrality. Their focus was on Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold Models.In both, at a given time, each node can be either active or inactive. Each node's tendency to become active increases monotonically as more of its neighbors become active, and an active node never becomes inactive again. Time unfolds in discrete steps.

Yaron Singer \cite{singer:winfriends} focused on economic sides of the problem. He studied and proposed mechanisms to increase the influence-ability of users by compensating them financially, to create incentives and reward users for spreading information.

In 2016, Xinran He and Kempe \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HeK16} proposed using multiple models simultaneously to predict influence spread. They argued that what defines a “social tie” can in many cases be fuzzy and unclear. They also argued that human behaviour is typically influenced by many environmental variables, such as interests and opinions matching a particular topic to be spread. Based on the assumption that multiple factors can affect the influence-ability of nodes, they designed an algorithm that finds nodes that are simultaneously influential for multiple functions. Their experiments showed that combining models improved the accuracy of spread prediction. Their research was funded by the U.S. Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, (DARPA) under Social Media in Strategic Communication (SMISC) program.


Goyal et Al \cite{goyal:datainfluence} proposed a novel approach in 2012. They argued that using probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations to scan a network for potential seed nodes isn't scalable for real world large networks. Their novel approach was to scan and exploit an Action Log, a log containing previous propagation traces and use those to distribute credit (influence probability score) throughout the network, avoiding the need for costly simulations. This is the approach we will be focusing on in this paper.


\section{Problem Statement}

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{|l|L|}
			\hline
			$G$ & A Directed Graph, $G = (V,E)$ \\\hline
			$V$ & Nodes, $V = \{u,v,w,x,...\}$ \\\hline
			$E$ & Edges, $E = \{(u, v),(w, v),(v,w),...\}$ \\\hline
			$S$ & Seed set of influencial nodes \\\hline
			$k$ & Number of nodes in a seed set \\\hline
			$\mathbb{G}$ & Set of graphs \\\hline
			$\sigma_m(S)$ & Expected number of nodes activated by a seed set \\\hline
	\end{tabulary}
	\caption{Graph Notation}
	\label{general-notation}
\end{table}

Our main goal, like others before us is to find a $k$ set of seed nodes $S$ that maximizes influence spread through a social network. The credit distribution model from Goyal et al has been proven to be a more scalable, efficient and accurate model than IC and LT discussed in \cite{kempe:maxspread}. \textit{The original influence maximization problem} is defined as follows.

\textsf{Problem 1 (Influence Maximization)}.\textit{Given a directed and edge-weighted social graph $ G = (V, E, p) $, a propagation model m, and a number $ k \leqslant |V| $, find a set $S \subseteq V , |S| = k,$ such that $\sigma_m (S)$ is maximum.}


Our contribution will be to compare the performance of the credit distribution model using multiple social graphs with varying structure and nature. The purpose is to gain insight and describe the properties of an optimal dataset for which this approach is the most suitable. From a set of multiple graphs and their accompanying action logs, we want to find the best one for the credit distribution model, the graph that gives us the highest achieved spread from a seed set.

\textit{Our problem statement} can be defined as follows.

\textsf{Problem 2 (Influence Maximization for multiple graphs)}.\textit{Given a set of directed and edge-weighted social graphs \\ $ \mathbb{G} = \{G_1(V_1, E_1,p_1), G_2(V_2, E_2, p_2),...,G_n(V_n, E_n,p_n) \} $, a propagation model m, and a number $ k \leqslant |V| $, find a graph G and a set $S \subseteq V , |S| = k,$ such that $\sigma_{Gm}(S_G)$ is maximum.}

In our case the model $m$ is Credit Distribution. This is the model that Goyal et al proposed in their paper \cite{goyal:datainfluence}.



\section{Suggested Approach}

We want to study the structure of various datasets to find out which characteristics are important for the CD model to be successful. We will compare the performance over multiple datasets and try to describe the attributes required for successful CD based influence spread. The datasets we are studying require different preprocessing approaches. One of our main challenges is the splitting of action logs $\mathbb{L}$ into meaningful training and test sets, in order to measure our accuracy in a meaningful manner. For credit distribution and spread prediction we are using the software provided in \cite{goyal:datainfluence} along with our own custom preprocessing scripts. After preprocessing, we use the previously mentioned software to select seed nodes, predict spread and compare with actual spread.

\subsection{Credit distribution model}

The process starts with the (unweighted) social graph and a log of past action propagations that say when each user performed an action. If we take a social music streaming service as an example, the log might contain recorded actions such as listening to a song. If a user listens to a song, and his friend later listens to the same song, we can consider the action to have propagated from the first user to his friend. The log is used to estimate influence probabilities among the nodes. This produces a directed edge-weighted graph which is then given as input to a greddy algorithm which produces a seed set. We look at potential influencers for actions performed by each node and distribute credit between nodes who previously performed the same action. Nodes can influence other nodes indirectly. The total propagation score for a pair of nodes is the sum of direct and indirect influence scores.

The seed selection process is described in detail in \cite{goyal:datainfluence}. We will briefly summarize some of the the most relevant points here. For each action performed by a node \textit{u} in our action log $\mathbb{L}$, the algorithm distributes credit evenly between direct neighbours \textit{w} of \textit{u}, if they performed the same action before \textit{u}. It also distributes credit backwards to all \textit{predecessors} of \textit{u} in \textit{G} who also performed the same action. To calculate the final score for a pair they use the formula in figure ~\ref{CD-formula}. See notation in table ~\ref{notation2}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{|l|L|}
			\hline
			$\mathbb{L}$ & Action log \\\hline
			$A_u$ & Total number of actions performed by node $u$ \\\hline
			$\gamma_{v,u}(a)$ & Direct influence credit given to $v$ for influencing $u$ for action a \\\hline
			$\Gamma_{v,u}(a)$ & Total credit given to $v$ for influencing $u$ for action $a$ \\\hline
			$\kappa_{v,u}$ & Total credit given to v for influencing u for all actions \\\hline
	\end{tabulary}
	\caption{CD Notation from Goyal et al. \cite{goyal:datainfluence}}
	\label{notation2}
\end{table}


\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{equation}
		\Gamma_{v,u}(a) = \displaystyle\sum_{w \in N_{in}(u,a)} \Gamma_{v,w}(a) \cdot \gamma_{w,u}(a)
	\end{equation}
	\label{CD-formula}
\end{figure}

While scanning the graphs and action logs, the algorithms add nodes to the seed set $S$ if they improve the total influence spread score by computing the marginal gain for each node addition. If there is no gain to adding a seed node to the set, it is discarded.

\subsection{Aggregating over all actions and all nodes}

Next, Goyal et al. described how they would aggregate the influence credit over the whole action log $\mathbb{L}$. Consider two nodes $v$ and $u$: the total influence credit given to $v$ by $u$ for all actions in $A$, is simply obtained by taking the total credit over all actions and normalizing it by the number of actions performed by $u$ (denoted $A_u$). This is justified by the fact that credits are assigned by $u$ backward to its potential influencers. In their paper \cite{goyal:datainfluence}, Goyal et al. defined the following formulas:

\begin{equation}
	\kappa_{v,u} = \frac{1}{A_u} \displaystyle\sum_{a \in A} \Gamma_{u,v}(a)
\end{equation}

\noindent This denotes the average credit given to $v$ for influencing $u$, over all actions that $u$ performs. Similarly, for the case of a set of nodes $S \subseteq V$ , they define the total influence credit for all the actions in $A$ as:
\begin{equation}
		\kappa_{S,u} = \frac{1}{A_u} \displaystyle\sum_{a \in A} \Gamma_{S,v}(a)
\end{equation}

\noindent Finally, they define the influence spread $\sigma_m{cd}(S)$ as the total influence credit given to $S$ from the whole social network:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{cd}(S) = \displaystyle\sum_{u\in V} \kappa_{S,u} = \displaystyle\sum_{u\in V} \frac{1}{A_u} \displaystyle\sum_{a \in A} \Gamma_{S,v}(a)
\end{equation}

This is the objective function that the algorithms in \cite{goyal:datainfluence} attempt to maximize. We will be comparing the seed sets and the influence credits obtained by various datasets, described in the next chapter.



\section{Datasets}

In order to find out which types of graphs are the most suitable for the credit distribution model, we need to study the characteristics of various social graphs and find links between their structure and the achieved spread for our seed sets of nodes. Our requirements are that each social graph needs to have an accompanying action log $\mathbb{L}$ containing previous propagation traces. We compared 4 datasets which will be described below.

\textbf{Flickr} \cite{data:flickr} is a social photo sharing platform. It's underlying social network is a directed graph. Users can follow each other and get notified of their friends submissions and activity. We used a subset of Flickr friendships as our social graph. Each action in the accompanying action log represents a user marking a photo as a favourite. We studied the propagation of this action accross friendships in the newtork. \cite{data:flickr-paper}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{degree-flixster.png}
	\centering
	\label{degree-flixster}
	\caption{Flickr's Degree Distribution}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Flixster} \cite{data:flixster} is an online social movie database. Flixter's action log consists of movie ratings. During the time that our dataset was collected, there was a widget on the front page of Flixster which suggested movies for users to rate. We looked at the propagations of these movie ratings throughout Flixter's friendship network. \cite{data:flixsterpaper}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{degree-flixster.png}
	\centering
	\label{degree-flixster}
	\caption{Flixster's Degree Distribution}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Digg} \cite{data:digg-friends,data:digg-votes,data:digg} Digg is social news aggregator. In it's previous form, users could "digg" or "bury" stories, similar to the upvoting and downvoting functionality on reddit. Digg had a global front page, which would look the same for every user at any given time. It isn't individually tailored like Twitter's front page. The front page featured stories which had high "digg" scores. In 2005, Digg added a friend list feature, which allowed users to follow each other's activity by clicking on a \textit{Friends Activity} tab. The frienship graph is directed, like Twitter, meaning that listing someone as a friend isn't neccesarily mutual. When user A lists user B as a friend, A can watch the activities of B but not vice versa. If B votes on a story, this action becomes visible to A. Our action log contains votes on stories and we will measure how they propagate. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1202-3162}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{degree-digg.png}
	\centering
	\label{degree-digg}
	\caption{Digg's Degree Distribution}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Twitter} \cite{data:twitter} is a directed social network. It has gained temendous popularity and widespread adoption in recent years for its ease of use. Users follow other users and can very easily "retweet" posts with a single click. This feature makes it easy for users to share and spread content with their followers. It simplifies the process of influencing followers and we suspect it might have a big impact on the performance of credit distribution influence maximization. The front page of Twitter is generated by algorithms which curate a news feed of potentially interesting tweets for each user based on who they follow and have interacted with in the past. Tweets can contain \textit{\#hashtags}, which represent certain topics. An example of a notable hashtag is \textit{\#metoo}, which has spread throughout the whole world in recent weeks. The hashtag and the women behind it were featured as the latest Time Magazine Person of the Year. Our action log for twitter is based on URLs that have propagated through retweets.

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{degree-twitter.png}
	\centering

	\caption{Twitter's Degree Distribution}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Preprocessing}
We convert each raw friendship network data to a new form containing three columns: use\_id, follower\_id and timestamp of becoming friend. Here the time of becoming friend is set to zero because we are only focusing on the static friendship network which doesn't grow any more as time unfolds. Then, each graph is pruned as a simple graph which does not contain self loops and parallel edges. Finally, the largest weakly connected component is detected from the directed graph is saved. This is the graph that we feed to the influence spread software from Goyal et al.

We also convert each action log, which is crawled from associated websites during a specific time period, into a form containing three columns: user\_id, action\_id and timestamp of performing this action. Here \textit{action} has different meaning in each specific dataset. In Flickr, action\_id refers to photo\_id marked as favorite, rated movie\_id in Flixster, voted story\_id in Digg , URL\_id contained in retweet in Twitter, respectively. We group the action log by action\_id and sort timestamps chronologically. Finally, we split the action log into training (80\%) and testing sets (20\%). The statistics of our datasets can be seen in Tables \ref{flixster-flickr-table} and Table \ref{twitter-digg-table}.

\section{Experiments and results}

\subsection*{Spread Achieved}
In our experiments, we compare the influence spread achieved by the seed sets obtained with the CD model. We ran the CD algorithm on four real social networks along with user activity logs. Considering the differences among those datasets in nature, we first compare Flixster and Flickr and then add Digg and Twitter.

First, we'll compare Flickr and Flixster in Figure \ref{spread2}. As we can see from the Flickr results, we barely managed any significant spread. The achieved number of activated nodes is about the same as the number of nodes in our seed set. This indicates that the action of marking a photo as a favourite does not propagate to friends. This might be due to the user interface. Photos favorited by friends do not become more prominent in the news feed, so these actions go unnoticed and do not affect the behaviour of friends. In the flixter data, each rating propagated to around 1 friend on average, which results in a score approximately two times higher than Flickr's.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{spread2.png}
	\centering
	\label{spread2}
	\caption{Achieved spread by seed sets under CD model on Flickr \& Flixster}
\end{figure}

In ~\ref{spread3} we see the achieved spread of Digg compared to Flickr and Flixster. We can clearly see from the total achieved spread that action propagations are much stronger in the Digg network compared to the other two. Interestingly, the ratio of nodes and edges is similar in Digg and Flixster. While the Flixster graph is larger, the overal achieved spread is much lower. From this we can presume that the size and sparsity of a network aren't the most significant factors int the performance of influence spread under the CD model. Digg actively promotes the action we are investigating, voting on stories. The title of the site is a reference to this particular action. The network is designed around this functionality. This active incentive combined with the distinct friend activity list encourages the propagation of actions. While the cumulative score in the previous data sets show a linear increase, the Digg scores follow a power curve.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{spread3.png}
	\centering
	\label{spread3}
    \caption{Achieved spread by seed sets under CD model on Digg, Flickr \& Flixster}
\end{figure}

While scanning the Twitter network, we saw noticable jumps in the overall influence spread score along the way. These jumps denote highly influencial nodes being detected, pulling the overall score up significantly. We also notice that the Twitter graph we studied is an even better fit than our Digg graph for influence maximization. As we can see from table ~\ref{twitter-digg-table}, Twitter contains a larger number of nodes and a lot more directed edges. The Twitter graph is more  interconnected with a higher average degree than the other networks. This is seemingly a good characteristic for influence spread. We presume that design elements of the website itself also affect propagations. The front page is uniquely tailored for each individual user, showing tweets that are likely to be of interest for each user. The primary purpose of Twitter's social network is to connect with and spread information to followers. The website revolves around the activity of "tweeting" bite size pieces of information and "retweeting" interesting tweets from others.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{spread4.png}
	\centering
	\label{spreadall}
    \caption{Achieved spread of all 4 networks}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Accuracy of Spread Prediction}
In this experiment, we evaluate methods using CD model based on different datasets. Figure \ref{accuracy} shows the relative error in the spread predicted by CD model, as a function of actual spread for different datasets. Actual spread refers to the total number of users who did perform the action. Predicted spread represents the total number of users who eventually get activated by seed users selected by our methods under CD model.

On one hand, actual spread under CD model based on both Digg and Twitter datasets is further and wider than that on Fixster and Flickr. Just as what we have explained in the previous experiment, Digg picked highly voted stories daily to feature on its front page using an exact promotion mechanism, and those stories are more likely to be propagated and voted in the next following days, so that actual spreads on Digg and Twitter are larger than the others. For Digg, we presume this is caused by the promotion algorithms that curate stories for users, showing trending and relevant data at all times. Users are more likely to react to currently relevant information. For Twitter, we assume this is becasue Twitter has infiltrated every aspect of our lives and people are prone to retweet some specific URLs either out of individual interest or out of a motivation of following the current trend. This feature of Twitter makes it have largest influence ability than the others.

On the other hand, the relative prediction error of CD model on Digg is obviously less than those on the other three datasets. The flicker and flixster networks don't seem reliable for our experiments. They both achieve a low spread score with a high relative error. The Digg network seems like our most reliable dataset. The overall relative error is low. Twitter achieves the highest spread, but there is an tradeoff between accuracy and spread. It is less predictable than the Digg network.

\section{Conclusions}

The previous literature that we studied focused on the efficiency of various influence maximization models. In this paper, we have discussed the characteristics of multiple networks and drawn conclusions about their structure. We've theorized about the effects of these differences on the accuracy and performance of the Credit Distribution model. Experimented with multiple datasets and studied their achieved spread and accuracy.  Our main conclusion is that the purpose of a network, the design of it's interfaces and the nature of the actions are all important factors in this type of research. It is benificial to focus on the propagation of actions that are promoted by the chosen network. The way data is presented to users affects their behavior. When social networking websites present data and actions to users in a meaningful, personalized manner, users are more likely to execute certain actions. From our experiments, we've concluded that by using the Twitter dataset and the action log of URL retweets, we can achieve a higher total spread than with the other networks. While we observed some key differences between our networks, there is still a lot of room for research in this field. Future research might dive more deeply into these different characteristics and elaborate further.
